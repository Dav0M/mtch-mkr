A semester-long group design project where we researched, designed, evaluated, and implemented a user interface. The process for this project spanned from identifying a specific population of users and possible opportunity to a high-fidelity prototype with user testing reports and heuristic evaluations. The overall result of our project was an A and very positive feedback from our peers during demo day :)

## Process

We started with identifying our project concept and preparing for user research related to this concept and it's feasibility. For our project we decided to address game matchmaking systems by creating an external matchmaker to combat the internal ones within online games. The goal of the app is to provide a solution to finding a team that matches your needs and wants for whatever game and task at hand. Our initial user research for this concept consisted of both interviews and online surveys directed at students at the UMN. Specifically, we distrbuted our surveys through student Discord channels with relations to video games and adjacent areas. 

Next was bringing the idea to life with sketches, low-fidelity prototypes, and then a high-fidelity prototype. With the sketches we defined the basic components of our app and created potential user personas and task descriptions/requirements. From there, we moved on to create a lo-fi prototype based on the sketches which would then be the basis for initial evaluations. The lo-fi prototype was evaluated by peers and ourselves using our defined tasks and requirements as a guideline. Using this feedback we then prepared a design brief to explain plans and rationale for our prototype before moving on to the hi-fi prototype. 

Once the initial hi-fi prototype was completed, we did some internal evaluations before conducting any user tests. These evaluations include cognitive walkthroughs and heuristic evaluations using [Nielsen's heuristics](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/). After making any necessary design changes based on the results from our internal evaluations we then conducted user testing. In our user tests we observed/tested the general use and impressions of the UI, task walkthroughs, usability and pain points, etc. Finally, with the feedback and notes from user tests we made any changes possible given the timeline and prepared a report for the final prototype.
